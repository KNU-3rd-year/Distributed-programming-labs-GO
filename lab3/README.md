**Topic**: Binary semaphores: Protecting shared memory access

## Part 3:
### Task:
**Topic:**
Implement using Golang

**Task:**
The second task is about Winnie the Pooh. In one forest live n bees and one bear, who use one pot of honey with 
a capacity of N sips. At first the pot is empty. Until the pot is full, the bear sleeps. As soon as the pot is full, 
the bear wakes up and eats all the honey, after which it falls asleep again. Each bee repeatedly collects one portion 
of honey and puts it in a pot. The bee that brings the last portion of honey wakes up the bear. 
Creates a multi-threaded application simulating the behavior of bees and bears.
