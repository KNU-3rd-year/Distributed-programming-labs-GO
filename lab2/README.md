## Video solution:
You can find a [short video](Lab%202%20solution%20video%20DP.mp4) about this lab!

## Part 1 and Part 2:
You can find this parts in [the Java-part repository](https://github.com/KNU-3rd-year/Distributed-programming-labs/tree/master/Lab2).

## Part 3:
### Task:
**Topic:**
Using an independent implementation of the synchronizer

**Task:**
Tasks about the Way of the Fist. On the gray slopes of the Himalayas stand two ancient Buddhist monasteries: 
Guan-Yin and Guan-Yan. Every year on the day of the Bodhisattva Aravatti's descent to earth, 
the monks of both monasteries gather for a joint festival and show their cultivation on the Way of the Fist. 
All those competing monks are divided into pairs, the winners of the pairs then fight among themselves and so on, 
until the final match. The monastery, whose monks won the final battle, takes the bodhisattva statue for safekeeping. 
Implement a multi-threaded application that determines the winner. 
An array is used as input data, which stores the amount of Qi energy of each monk. 
When deciding to use the principle of dichotomy.
